# Final Project Orange
# Drive-Storage

## Current Base Requirements

+ Upload/Download files
+ Create folders to group files (currently no nested folders)
+ Move files between folders
+ Move folders to trash (moves contents to trash recursively)
+ Move files to trash on delete (not permanent deletion)
+ Trash can permanently delete files (deletion from trash is permanent)
+ Trash can permanently delete folders (deletion from trash is permanent, deletes all contents)


## Low-Priority Considerations

+ Upload/Download entire folders including contents
+ Consider addition of nested folders support
